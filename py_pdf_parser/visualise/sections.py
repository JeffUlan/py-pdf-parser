class SectionVisualiser:
    """
    Used internally to draw outlines of sections on the visualise plot.

    We first try to draw a simple rectangle around the section with a fixed margin, for
    increasingly small margins. If this doesn't work (because an element that is not
    in the section would be within the section outline rectangle) then we instead
    construct the boundary as follows:

    We create a Voronoi diagram around all of the elements on the page, and the page
    boundaries (actually we get a diagram around each side of the bounding box of each
    element). Then for each line in the diagram we check if it was generated between one
    box which is in the section and one which isn't, and if so we draw it.

    This produces some slightly interested outlines, and so we also run a simplification
    check. This takes three points on the outline, and if the triangle created by
    joining them together doesn't contain any of our elements, we can remove the middle
    point to make the whole shape a bit simpler.

    It can still produce some slightly interesting shapes, but does work fairly well.
    Importantly, every element in the section will be within the outline, and no boxes
    which are not in the section will be (which cannot always be achieved by simply
    drawing a rectangle around all the points in the section).

    It does add some time when changing page on the visualise tool, but the whole
    process is done in <0.5 sections which is acceptable for a development tool.
